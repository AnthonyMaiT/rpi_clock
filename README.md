OVERVIEW

This git project constitutes a Raspberry Pi Clock & Weather display (rpi_clock), based on https://github.com/goodtft/LCD-show and the Quimat 3.5" TFT Touch Screen with a 320x480 resolution.

I used a Raspberry Pi 2.  It would not be terribly difficult to modify the rpi_clock.py Python 3 script to employ 

* Another touch-screen display which interfaces with the Raspberry Pi 2 or 3.
* Another Linux distribution or any O.S. which supports Python 3

TECHNICAL CONTENTS

Subfolders:

* bin - rpi_clock.py (Python 3 source code)
* docs - project documentation (admittedly, skimpy at the moment)

GETTING STARTED

The starting point with this project is the docs/preparation_notes.txt file.  Just follow the instructions of this note.  

AFTERTHOUGHTS

Admittedly, there seems to be other 3.5" TFT display products which do NOT require special drivers as of the lastest Raspbian during 2017 (more desirable IMO).  In fact, the Quimat product might too.  I just got caught in the middle!  Some time in the future, I might try it without the Quimat-supplied driver software.

Will this work on a Pi Zero?  Pi A or B?

Feel free to contact richard.elkins@gmail.com for inquiries and issues, especially if you find any bugs.  I'll respond as soon as I can.
