OVERVIEW

This git project constitutes a Raspberry Pi Clock & Weather display (rpi_clock), based on https://github.com/goodtft/LCD-show and the Quimat 3.5" TFT Touch Screen with a 320x480 resolution.

Note that it would not be terribly difficult to modify the rpi_clock.py Python 3 script to employ 

* Another display which interfaces with the Raspberry Pi
* Another Linux distribution or any O.S. which supports Python 3
