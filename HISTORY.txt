On Linux, if you've recently had a system update, the pi user might see a zenity dialog that covers up the RPi Clock display.  
Instructions for modifying the user pi .profile has been added to rpi_clock/docs/preparation_notes.txt so that 
any such zenity dialogs are automatically signaled to close.
